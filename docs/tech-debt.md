# Tech Debt

The live backlog from the 2026-09-04 whole-tree audit (reuse, simplification,
efficiency, altitude). Present tense, like every other page: each entry says
what the code does now and what it should do. An entry is DELETED when its
change lands — git holds the story, this page holds only what is still open.
Items are ordered by value within each section; the **Decisions** are the
owner's, taken 2026-09-04, and bound the work.

**Decisions.** One-shot migrations are deleted, not kept (single developer,
one device each; a stale install re-defaults). Hash-changing efficiency work
is re-blessed with a before/after render for an A/B by ear.

## Open items

None. The audit's entries have all landed or been declined; a decline and
its reason live in the commit that removed the entry. A new finding goes
here as a numbered entry under its section (altitude, reuse,
simplification, efficiency), in the present tense.
